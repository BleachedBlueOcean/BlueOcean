## Wins and Improvements

One of the biggest wins with this project was the ability to quickly build a web application that allowed users to make informed decisions when buying and selling cryptocurrencies. We were able to use React, Figma, Firebase, Node.js, Vite, Material UI, and ES6 to build an application that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing while also able to stream live market data and news.

Some areas that could be improved upon include the speed of the application. There were times when the application was slow to load or slow to respond. Additionally, we could improve the user experience by adding more features and including a quick tutorial on site usage via text bubbles. As a stretch goal to be more inline with current exchange web apps, implementing options, short-sell, and various other market equity options.
