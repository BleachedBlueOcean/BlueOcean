## Wins and Improvements

One of the biggest wins with this project was the ability to quickly build a web application that allowed users to make more informed decisions when buying and selling stocks. We were able to use React, Figma, Firebase, Node.js, Express, and JavaScript to build an application that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Some areas that could be improved upon include the speed of the application. There were times when the application was slow to load or slow to respond. Additionally, we could improve the user experience by adding more features and making the user interface more intuitive.
